# Grid Meets Flexbox

#### Instructions

1. Create a `Header` with a `nav` element that contains navigation links.
2. Align the children of the `Header` element into place using css flexbox.
   - Define their ``flex-grow`` properties.
3. Use css grid to create a grid layout that matches the reference image.
  - Define the ``grid-template-areas`` for the grid layout.
  - Use different ``background-color`` for each ``grid-area``.

- Use different css properties and fonts as you fit to enhance the design.
