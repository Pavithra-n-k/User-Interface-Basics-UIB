# Movie Genres

**Instructions**:

1.  Create a section with the class `.genres`. Make it a flex-container.
2.  Inside the flex-container, 6 sections with the following content and background-colors. They should be created in the following order:
    - Action → rgb(30, 144, 255);
    - Thriller → rgb(190, 178, 178)
    - Comedy → rgb(255, 214, 30)
    - Horror → rgb(0, 0, 0)
    - Drama → rgb(169, 169, 169)
    - Romance → rgb(255, 0, 0);
3. For each section, center the text.
4. Each flex-item should have a base width of 200px and a fixed height of 100px. By default, each flex-item should take up all available space.
5. The `romance` section should take up three times as much space as the other sections.
6. The `comedy` section should take up six times as much space as the other sections.

**Hint**: Consider using flex-wrap to achive 5 and 6.
